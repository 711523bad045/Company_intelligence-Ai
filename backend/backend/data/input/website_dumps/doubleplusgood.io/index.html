    <h2>DevOps tooling we use</h2>
    <p>
    We take a pragmatic approach to DevOps tooling; we use the right tool for
    the job. Whenever possible we adapt the tooling your team is already using
    rather than unnecessarily introducing new tools. We have proven experience
    helping companies with the following tools: Kubernetes, Google Cloud Run,
    Serverless, Terraform, Ansible, Chef, Packer, Docker, GitHub (including
    GitHub actions), GiLab (including its built-in CI/CD system), CircleCI,
    Jenkins and others.
    </p>
    <p>
    We've helped companies with PHP, Laravel, Ruby on Rails, Node.js and Python
    SaaS applications speed up, scale and deploy quickly and more reliably.
    </p>
    <p>
    Like many organisations, most of our work is done in the cloud. We have
    experience with AWS, GCP, Azure, Linode and Digital Ocean but have also
    worked with on-premise infrastructure.
    </p>
    <p>
    Companies have used our services to utilise these tools to help them deploy
    quicker, improve their developer velocity, and reduce costs.
    </p>

    <h2>Our process</h2>
    <p>
      We work with you to understand your business and technical requirements
      and then use our experience to help you achieve your goals. For startups
      this usually means embedding one of our experts with your team for a
      fortnight to understand your platform and requirements. Our expert will
      then consult with the rest of our team to come up with a plan to help you
      achieve your goals.
    </p>
    <p>
      We will then implement the plan, working with your technical team to 
      ensure they understand the concepts and any tools we are using, ensuring
      we level-up your team as well as your infrastructure.
